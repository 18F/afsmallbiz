What is SABER?
======
The system consists of a hypermedia REST service powered using the Python [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) microframework.
The system is driven by an abstract rule engine so that business logic is encapsulated in the database and customizable by system users without changing the core code.

Responses are in [Hypermedia Application Language (HAL)](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) and standard JSON format.

Running the Server Locally
======
First, install Vagrant.

To run the server, type
```
vagrant up
```
